# web-scraping-challenge
module assignment 11
Hello, the following is a repository of sample Mars data for the purpose of washington university boot camp for data analytics. 
In this assignment you will find code to scrap data from two webpages. 

The first ("part_1_mars_news.ipynb"), scraps news stories about mars. It gathers the Title, preview text, and date of news articles and stores them in a list of dictionaries. 

The Second ("part_2_mars_weather.ipynb"), scaps a page containing temperature and pressure readings from the Curiousity Rover over a sample set of data. It stores the information in a pandas dataframe and provides some visual analysis for average temperature, average pressure, and number of mars days in an Earth year.
